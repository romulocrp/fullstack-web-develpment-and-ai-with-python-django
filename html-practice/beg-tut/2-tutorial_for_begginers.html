    <h1>HTML Tutorial for Begginers</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      <b>HTML is the king of the internet</b>, any webpage you see has some of kind
      HTML to organize information on your screen, here you're going to learn
      how to write your first HTML file, hence, webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to start, the program you will use to write your code is
      important, you can use any kind of text editor to write your code,
      although some programs are easier to write on, like <b>Atom</b> which has
      a great HTML extension and make easier to write code on it.
    </p>
    <h3>Making a HTML document</h3>
    <p>
      For starter, to write a HTML file that results in a webpage, first the
      kind of document needs to be declared in order to be parsed by the
      browser, to do that a simple <code> !DOCTYPE html</code> can be writen
      on top of the page as a tag so all browser have a standard way to parse
      HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is standard for all HTML5 webpages, in case you want to write some
      HTML4 webpage, document type declaration is way different and also
      browser specific.
    </p>
    <h3>Tags</h3>
    <p>
      Tags are the building blocks of HTML, in more formal way, they help
      browsers to identify the kind of <b>element</b> to display a format for a
      given content. The syntax is very easy to understand, opening tag,
      content, closing tag, there is also some tags that doesn't have a closing
      tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a browser reads a HTML file it parses the document from top to
      bottom, from left to right. Tags create documents and render properties,
      each tag with it's own properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Head and body</h3>
    <p>
      In order to create a new web page with HTML text understandable by the
      browsers, there is some standard tags needed to be declared, first its the
      <code>html</code> tag, this tag is used as the root of the document, also
      this tag serves as the container to all other HTML tags so is important to
      help the browser parse HTML text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important feature of the HTML tag is the <code>lang</code>
      property, which also helps the browser to understand the language on which
      it must perform the parsing and also web searches to find your pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next tag important for HTML file is the <code>head</code> tag, its
      main purpose is to store metadata about the page, metadata is data about
      the page itself, and is not displayed to the viewer. Metadata is usually
      document title, character set, styles, scripts and more. Document title
      being the obligated element in every <code>head</code> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to have a good definition of document, the use of
      <code>meta</code> tag to define the charset through the
      <code>charset</code> property and <code>title</code> tag to define
      document title.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last but not least tag to use on a HTML file is the <code>body</code>
      tag, body is where all the content of the page will be stored, such as
      headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tabls, lists, etc. In order to
      keep track of what is happening on the file, only one body can be used
      per document.
    </p>
    <h3>Text Formatting</h3>

      elements that can help to make text more friendly for the reader.
